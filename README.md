# Yaru818

My personal fork of the yaru theme (for cinnamon and gtk).

## Installation

### Prerequisites

It is recommended to install the [humanity-icon-theme] first, as our icon pack
depends on it.

```sh
sudo apt install ./humanity-icon-theme_VERSION.deb
```

### Distribution packages

**â€¢ Debian package (.deb)**\
Download the debian package from [releases] and install-it.

```sh
sudo apt install ./yaru818-theme_VERSION.deb
```

## Configuration

1. Select `Yaru818-dark` in the theme settings of your desktop-manager.\
   To apply it automatically to Cinnamon, run:
   ```sh
   gsettings set org.cinnamon.desktop.interface gtk-theme Yaru818-dark
   gsettings set org.cinnamon.desktop.interface icon-theme Yaru818-dark
   gsettings set org.cinnamon.theme name Yaru818-dark
   ```

2. Enable the dark variant by default in GTK applications:\
   *(otherwise some applications will use the light variant)*
   ```
   gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.interface color-scheme 'prefer-dark'
   ```

### Flatpak

The package is designed to support Flatpak easily (despite
https://github.com/flatpak/flatpak/issues/4896 /
https://github.com/flatpak/flatpak/issues/5040).

To enable Flatpak support, run the following command (as user, not as root!):

```sh
/opt/yaru818-theme/configure-flatpak
```

### Cinnamon configuration

- Font Selection:
    - Default font: Sans Regular 9
    - Window title font: Sans Regular 9

## Build

```sh
# 1. Copy relevant upstream files to the local directory

./patch.sh

# 3. Run meson and ninja to build the local directory

# 4. Optional: Install locally
